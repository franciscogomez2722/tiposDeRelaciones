'''
The combination relation represents the relation between the whole and the part of the class, and the whole and the part
have a constant lifetime. Once the overall object does not exist, some of the objects will not exist and all will die in
the same lifetime.

 --------------------------------------------->  key question  <-------------------------------------------------------
key question ðŸ¤”: What is the difference between aggregation relationship and composition relationship?

-If the parts can continue to exist independently, even if the main object disappears, then it is aggregation.

-If the parts are completely dependent on the main object and cease to exist when the main object disappears, then it is composition.

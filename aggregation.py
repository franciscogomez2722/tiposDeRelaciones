'''
Aggregate relationships represent the relationship between the whole and a part of the class, member objects are part
 of the general object, but the member object can exist independently of the general object.

 --------------------------------------------->  key question  <-------------------------------------------------------
key question ðŸ¤”: What is the difference between aggregation relationship and composition relationship?

-If the parts can continue to exist independently, even if the main object disappears, then it is aggregation.

-If the parts are completely dependent on the main object and cease to exist when the main object disappears, then it is composition.
